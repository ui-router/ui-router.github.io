This guide provides a conceptual overview to UI-Router views, nested views, and named views.

Note: the concepts discussed in this guide apply to all UI frameworks supported by UI-Router (e.g., React, Angular, AngularJS).
However, the exact syntax for views varies.
Likewise, each framework's component structure and DOM output also varies.
In this guide, we will use pseudocode and pseudo DOM output to demonstrate the concepts.

# View Declaration

UI-Router applications are modeled as a tree of states.
Each application state (generally) has a view declared on it.
The view is the component which provides the user interface for that state.

When an application state is activated, the view (component) for that state is rendered.

```js
var state = {
  name: 'home',
  component: HomeComponent
}
```

When the `home` state is acivated, the `HomeComponent` is rendered.
{: .notice--info}

# UI-View Viewport

A `uiview` is a viewport component provided by UI-Router.
When a state is activated, the state's view (component) is rendered into the appropriate `uiview` viewport.

When an app renders a `uiview`, it becomes a viewport for views (components) to be loaded into.
{: .notice--info}

Typically, an application will render a single top-level `uiview` at the root of the component tree, near the `body` tag.
The `uiview` will be filled by the component of a top-level state.

```
<html>
  <body>
    <uiview>
      <!-- When 'home' state is activated, the
           'HomeComponent' is rendered here -->
    </uiview>
  </body>
</html>
```

# Nested views

Application UIs often drill down from more general information to more specific information.

Take for example an imagined email application.
The email client displays folders on the left, shows a list of messages, and has a message preview below.

```
+---------+---------------------------------+
|*INBOX*  |  MESSAGE1                       |
| SPAM    | *MESSAGE2*                      |
| DELETED |  MESSAGE3                       |
| SENT    +---------------------------------+
|         | MESSAGE 2 CONTENT               |
|         |                                 |
|         |                                 |
|         |                                 |
+---------+---------------------------------+
```

This UI drills down from more general to more specific: `folder list -> message list -> message content`.
{: .notice--info}

Assume we modeled our application states in the following hierarchy:

```
var states = [
  { 
    name: 'folderlist',
    component: FolderListComponent
  },
  {
    name: 'folderlist.messagelist',
    component: MessageListComponent
  },
  {
    name: 'folderlist.messagelist.message',
    component: MessageContentComponent
  }
];
```

These three states form a nested parent/child state hierarchy.
The `folderlist` state is the parent of the nested `folderlist.messagelist` state.
Likewise, `folderlist.messagelist` is the parent of the nested `folderlist.messagelist.message` state.
{: .notice--info}

When the `folderlist` parent state is active, its `FolderListComponent` renders the list of folders and a nested `uiview` viewport.
As long as no child state is active, the nested `uiview` is empty.

```html
<FolderListComponent>
  <ul class="left">
    <li>INBOX</li>
    <li>SPAM</li>
    <li>DELETED</li>
    <li>SENT</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="right">
    <uiview></uiview>
  </div>
</FolderListComponent>
```

When a user selects a folder, the nested `folderlist.messagelist` state is activated.
The state's `MessageListComponent` component fills the nested `uiview` viewport, which is created in the `folderlist` state.
The `MessageListComponent` component renders a list of message summaries for the selected folder, i.e., message sender, title, and date/time received.
It also renders another nested `uiview` viewport.

```html
<FolderListComponent>
  <ul class="left">
    <li>INBOX</li>
    <li>SPAM</li>
    <li>DELETED</li>
    <li>SENT</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="right">
    <uiview>
      <MessageListComponent class="top">
        <ul>
          <li>Message 1</li>
          <li>Message 2</li>
          <li>Message 3</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="bottom">
          <uiview></uiview>
        </div>
      </MessageListComponent>
    </uiview>
  </div>
</FolderListComponent>
```

When the user selects a specific message from the message list, the nested `folderlist.messagelist.message` state is activated.
The `MessageContentComponent` is then rendered inside the nested `uiview` viewport (from the `folderlist.messagelist` state).

```html
<FolderListComponent>
  <ul class="left">
    <li>INBOX</li>
    <li>SPAM</li>
    <li>DELETED</li>
    <li>SENT</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="right">
    <uiview>
      <MessageListComponent class="top">
        <ul>
          <li>Message 1</li>
          <li>Message 2</li>
          <li>Message 3</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="bottom">
          <uiview>
            <MessageContentComponent>
              <p>Date: 2017-08-01</p>
              <p>Sender: GlobalCorp Bank</p>
              <p>Subject: Need a loan?</p>
              <div class="body">
                <p>Hey you! We have the best loans.</p>
                <p>You should really get a loan.</p>
                <p>Loans are awesome.</p>
              </div>
            </MessageContentComponent>
          </uiview>
        </div>
      </MessageListComponent>
    </uiview>
  </div>
</FolderListComponent>
```

As each nested state is activated, its view is rendered into the nested `uiview` viewport from its parent state.
{: .notice--info}

# Multiple named uiviews

So far we've only shown states which have a single view (component) defined.
However, UI-Router allows *multiple views* to be defined on a single state.
These views can be rendered into multiple `uiview` viewports throughout the page.

## Layouts

Using this approach, you can define a layout with named sections.
For instance, you may define a layout with a header, navigation and main content area.

```
+-------------------------------------------+
|                   HEADER                  |
|------+------------------------------------|
|      |                                    |
|      |                                    |
| NAV  |        MAIN CONTENT AREA           |
|      |                                    |
|      |                                    |
+------+------------------------------------+
```

To create a layout, render multiple `uiview` components from a parent component.
Give each `uiview` a name.

```html
<ParentComponent>
  <ui-view name="top"></uiview>

  <div class="bottom">
    <ui-view name="left"></uiview>
    <ui-view name="right"></uiview>
  </div>
</ParentComponent>
```

## Defining Named Views

To use multiple views, a state should target named `uiview`s with a component.
Add a `views:` property to your state definition instead of a `component:`.
The `views` property should be an object.
The keys of the object are the names of the views being targeted and the values are the component to render.

```js
var mainState = {
  name: 'main',
  views: {
    header: HeaderComponent,
    nav: NavComponent,
    content: MainComponent,
  }
}
```

Consult the framework specific documentation for exact syntax.
{: .notice--info}

When the `main` state is activated, each of the three components are rendered into the matching named `uiview`.

# Targeting a named `uiview`

The keys on the `views` object determine which `uiview` will render the named view's component.
There are multiple ways to target a named `uiview`.

## View Name Only

The most common mechanism to target named `uiview`s is to use the uiview name only.
When the `views` key is a simple name such as `nav`, UI-Router targets the `uiview` named `nav` which was created __by the parent state__.

```js
var parent = {
  name: 'parent',
  component: ParentComponent
}
var child = {
  name: 'parent.child',
  views: {
    // targets uiview name='nav' created by ParentComponent
    'nav': NavComponent, 
    // targets uiview name='header' created by ParentComponent
    'header': HeaderComponent,
  }
}
```

## View Name + State Name

Another mechanism to target named `uiview`s is to use the uiview name and also the state that created it.
This allows you to target a `uiview` created by some grandparent state.
To use this targeting approach, the `views` key should be formatted as `<viewname>@<statename>`.

```js
var grandparent = {
  name: 'grandparent',
  component: GrandParentComponent
}
var parent = {
  name: 'grandparent.parent',
  component: ParentComponent
}
var child = {
  name: 'grandparent.parent.child',
  views: {
    // targets uiview name='nav' created in 'grandparent' state
    'nav@grandparent': NavComponent, 
    // targets uiview name='header' created in 'grandparent' state
    'header@grandparent': HeaderComponent
  }
}
```

# Re-targeting a uiview from a nested state

An ancestor state can render a `uiview` which is then filled by a child state.
If the child state __itself has children__, those children can re-target the `uiview` with a new view.
When the grandchild state is activated, the view from its parent is replaced by the view from the grandchild.

```js
var parent = {
  name: 'parent',
  // renders a nested uiview named 'content'
  component: ParentComponent
}
var child = {
  name: 'parent.child',
  views: {
    // targets uiview name='content' created by 'parent' state
    'content@parent': ChildComponent,
  }
}
var grandchild = {
  name: 'parent.child.grandchild',
  views: {
    // targets uiview name='content' created by 'parent' state
    // overrides the view from 'child' and replaces it with this component
    'content@grandparent': GrandChildComponent,
  }
}
```

When `parent.child` is active, the `ChildComponent` fills the `uiview` named `content`.
When `parent.child.grandchild` is active, the `GrandChildComponent` fills the `uiview` named `content`.
The `ChildComponent` from `parent.child` is no longer rendered.
{: .notice--info}

# Advanced view targeting

Although two view targeting mechanisms already covered are by far the most common,
there are more advanced mechanisms that may be useful in certain cases. 

## Relative Parent State

This mechanism is very similar to *View Name + State Name*.
However, instead of targeting a state using its exact name, the state can be targeted relatively, up the hierarchy.

When targeting relatively, the caret (`'^'`) is used to go up one state in the hierarchy.
{: .notice--info}

To target a view in the parent state, use `'^'`.
To target a view in the grandparent state, use `'^.^'`.
To target a view in the great-grandparent state, use `'^.^.^'` (and so on).

```js
var grandparent = {
  name: 'grandparent',
  component: GrandParentComponent
}
var parent = {
  name: 'grandparent.parent',
  component: ParentComponent
}
var child = {
  name: 'grandparent.parent.child',
  views: {
    // targets uiview name='nav' created in 'grandparent' state
    'nav@^.^': NavComponent, 
  }
}
```

## Absolute UIView Addressing

In some cases, it may be easier to target a named `uiview` by following its nesting path in the DOM.
When `uiview`s are nested inside each other, they can be addressed by chaining their names together.

Every `uiview` has a name. Unnamed `uiview`s are implicitly named `$default`.
{: .notice--info}

When using absolute addressing, add a key to the `views` object.
Prefix it with an exclamation point (`!`) and chain the `uiview` names together using a period (`.`).

For example, given the following nested `uiview` structure...

```html
<uiview> <!-- unnamed -->
  <uiview name="master">
    <uiview name="detail">
    </uiview>
  </uiview>
</uiview>
```

... to absolutely target the `uiview` named `detail`, use: `!$default.master.detail`.
  
```js
var state = {
  name: 'foo.bar.baz',
  views: {
    '!$default.master.detail': DetailsComponent
  }
}
```

## Generalized Addressing

There are numerous ways to address a named `uiview` at a particular state.
However, all these forms of addressing are specialized variations of the generalized addressing scheme.

Generalized addressing is `[uiview path]@[state anchor]`.
The `[uiview path]` is the names of nested `uiview`s, joined together using a dot (`.`).
The `[state anchor]` is the name of the state which rendered the first `uiview` in the `uiview path`.

Generalized Address Example 1:
: `main.nestedview@home.child`

This example Targets the uiview named `nestedview`, which is nested inside the uiview named `main`, which was created by the `home.child` state.

Generalized Address Example 2:
: `$default.$default@^.^`

This example Targets the unnamed uiview, which is nested inside another unnamed uiview, which was created by the grandparent state.

---

All the other forms of view addressing are derived from these two forms of generalized addressing.

|------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| View Name Only         | `header`          | Shorthand for `header@^`, uiview path: `header`, state anchor: parent state |
| View Name + State Name | `nav@home.main`   | uiview path: `nav`, state anchor: `home.main`                               |
| Relative Parent State  | `nav@^.^`         | uiview path: `nav`, state anchor: grandparent state                         |
| Absolute UIView        | `!content.detail` | Shorthand for `content.detail@`, uiview path: `content.detail`,  state anchor: the empty string (e.g., the root state) |
